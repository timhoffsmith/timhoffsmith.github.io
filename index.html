	<h1>Theodore P. Imhoff-Smith.</h1>
	<p>I'm a <b>Neuroscience PhD student</b> working in the <b>Radiology Department</b> in the <b>University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health</b>.
	</p>
	<p>My work leverages science, statistics, and advanced computational methods to investigate the complex relationships between brain structure, function, and physiology, with a particular focus on neurological and psychiatric conditions.
	</p>
	<p>In my current studies, I'm working to understand the interplay of neuroinflammation, brain structure, and network dynamics in focal epilepsy with a focus on medication-refractory cases. By integrating cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and computational analyses, I aim to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and treatment resistance. The ultimate goal of this work is to identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to enhance assessment, classification, treatment, and quality of life.
	</p>
	<p>Prior to joining the Radiology Department, I worked at the Center for Healthy Minds, where I investigated the neurobiological mechanisms underlying stress, sleep, and inflammation, with a focus on their interactions with trauma and chronic conditions like asthma. This work involved multimodal neuroimaging and physiological analyses, including resting state connectivity, task fMRI, heart rate variability, respiration, and skin conductance measures.
