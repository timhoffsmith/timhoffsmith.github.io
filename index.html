	<h1>Theodore P. Imhoff-Smith.</h1>
	<p>I'm a <b>Neuroscience PhD student</b> in the <b>NeuroImaging Research Program</b> at the <b>University of Wisconsin - Madison</b>.
	</p>
	<p>I use science, statistics, and code to better understand the multidirectional relationships between physiology, emotion, and stress, and how these processes interact with social cognition in conditions like epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. With a more holistic understanding of the dynamic contexts in which these functions exist, we can identify better opportunities for intervention.
	</p>
	<p>In my current studies, I am working with multimodal measures of physiology and behavior to isolate and understand the dynamic biological systems that give rise to common social and emotional features in neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g. epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder). Prior to my PhD I worked at the Center for Healthy Minds where I studied relationships between stress, emotion, and physiology in patients with asthma and post-traumatic stress.
