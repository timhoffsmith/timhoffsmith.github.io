	<h1>Theodore P. Imhoff-Smith.</h1>
	<p>Research specialist at the <b>Center for Healthy Minds</b> and the <b>University of Wisconsin-Madison</b>.</p>
	<p>I'm a graduate of UW-Madison with primary training in psychology and computer science. I have experience in social and psychophysiology research methodologies and spent a few years in the healthcare software development industry where I conducted usability research and tested data and software quality.
	</p>
	<p>I aim to use science to better understand the relationships between physiology, neural circuitry, and affective arousal, how these mechanisms interact with social behavior, and how these processes can go awry such as in PTSD, mood, and anxiety disorders. By understanding how deficits in emotion regulation arise and the context in which these basic functions can fail, my hope is that we can identify vulnerabilities to mental illness and reveal opportunities for intervention.
