	<h1>Theodore P. Imhoff-Smith.</h1>
	<p>I'm a <b>neuroscience PhD student</b> in the NeuroImaging Research Program at the <b>University of Wisconsin - Madison</b>.
	</p>
	<p>Broadly speaking, I aim to use science to better understand the relationships between neural circuitry, physiology, stress, and emotion, how these processes interact with social behavior, and how these processes can go awry. By understanding context in which these vital functions can fail, my hope is that we can identify vulnerabilities to illness and reveal opportunities for intervention.
	</p>
	<p>My current work seeks to isolate and understand the dynamic biological systems that give rise to common social and emotional features in neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g. epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder). I work with multimodal measures of physiology and behavior to achieve these goals.
	</p>
	<p>Prior to my PhD I worked at the Center for Healthy Minds where I studied relationships between stress, emotion, and physiology in patients with asthma and post-traumatic stress. I also spent a few years in the healthcare software development industry where I conducted usability research and tested data and software quality.
