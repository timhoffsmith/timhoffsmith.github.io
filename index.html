	<h1>Theodore P. Imhoff-Smith.</h1>
	<p>I'm a <b>Neuroscience PhD student</b> in the <b>NeuroImaging Research Program</b> at the <b>University of Wisconsin - Madison</b>.
	</p>
	<p>I use science, statistics, and computers to better understand the relationships between physiology, emotion, stress, and how these processes interact with social cognition.
	</p>
	<p>In my current studies, I am working with multimodal measures of physiology and behavior to isolate and understand the dynamic biological systems that give rise to common social and emotional features in epilepsy. Prior to my PhD I worked at the Center for Healthy Minds where I studied relationships between stress, emotion, and physiology in patients with asthma and post-traumatic stress.
